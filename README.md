# OC Renewal Wizard – React (Vite + TypeScript)

This is a ready-to-run project scaffold for the OC Renewal Wizard you built in ChatGPT.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> The preview uses Tailwind via CDN, so there's no Tailwind config required.

## Add Your Full App Code
Open `src/App.tsx` and replace the placeholder with your full app code from the ChatGPT canvas titled **"Oc Renewal Wizard – Static React Preview"**.

When done, just refresh the browser tab running Vite (or save to trigger HMR).

## Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
